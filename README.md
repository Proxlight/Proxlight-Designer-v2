## üí° Introduction

Proxlight Designer was created to speed up the GUI-development process in Python. It uses the well-known design software [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to make creating beautiful Tkinter GUIs in Python a piece of cake.

Proxlight Designer uses the Figma API to analyse a design file and create the respective code and files needed for the GUI. Even Proxlight Designer's GUI is created using Proxlight Designer.

## üìê How it Works
The only thing the user needs to do is design an interface with Figma, and then paste the Figma file URL and API token into Proxlight Designer.

Proxlight Designer will automatically generate all the code and images required to create the GUI in Tkinter.

## üéØ Examples
The possibilities are endless with Proxlight Designer, but here are a couple of GUIs that can be perfectly replicated in Tkinter.

## üî• Showcase
If your app was made with Proxlight Designer, let me know. It will be helpful for others to see more examples!  
(See: [Contact Me](#-contact-me))

___
<br>
 

* Background &mdash; should be named `Background` (in Figma)
* Buttons &mdash; should be named `Button` (in Figma)
   * When creating a button, add a Rectangle behind the actual button with the same color as the background color.
* Entry &mdash; should be named `TextBox` (in Figma)
* Rectangles &mdash; should be named `Rectangle` (in Figma)
* Text &mdash; All text in the design should be created as text.


Before converting a Figma file to Python code using Proxlight Designer, make sure that both the X &amp; Y coordinates of the frame are 0.
