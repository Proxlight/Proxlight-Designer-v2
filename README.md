## üí° Introduction

Proxlight Designer was created to speed up the GUI-development process in Python. It uses the well-known design software [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to make beautiful Tkinter GUIs in Python.

Proxlight Designer uses the [Figma API](https://www.figma.com/developers/api) to analyse a design file and create the respective code and files needed for the GUI. Even Proxlight Designer's GUI is created using Proxlight Designer.
